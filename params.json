  "tagline": "",
  "body": "Many people in the world suffer from disabilities that affect their speech. There are varying degrees of disabilities. For instance, an individual may have limited control of their hands while another individual may only have eye movement. \r\n Although there are devices available, these devices are often expensive and may require a learning period to use the device effectively. I SPEECH is my attempt to offer an open source free software program that anyone with a laptop and a webcam can use freely. \r\nTo help people with varying degrees of disability, I SPEECH will have 3 modes of operation--keypad to voice, mouse click to voice, and eye movement to voice. \r\n Hopefully, I SPEECH will help improve the quality of life for someone with one of these disabilities",
